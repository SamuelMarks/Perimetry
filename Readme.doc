HOW TO CONFIGURE THE PROGRAM FOR TEST:
INSTALLATION:
To run the program copy the java file to the  .java fie to the plugin folder in the  installation folder of imageJ  (C:\Program Files\ImageJ\plugins)
Then open ImageJ and run the program.

MAKING FULL SCREEN IMAGE WINDOW:

The program will ask of some information like height ,width of the image window, name of the patient, bit depth etc.

After entering all these, the image window will open but it may not be full screen at the first attempt.  It has to be adjusted to cover full screen. To do that following fields must be changed
1>	Check the resolution of the monitor which is being used and set the parameters of the method win.setLocationAndSize(0,0,1650,950); according to that. First set the 3rd and 4th same as the resolution.
2>	Then run the program and set the parameters width and height same as the resolution.

After setting these parameters the window should cover full screen. If in spite of this it does not cover full area, then after minor adjustments in the same parameters this can be achieved.







SETTING DISTANCE OF THE PATIENT’S HEAD:

Once the correct information fields for the full screen are found out the program can be rerun with those information setting as default.

While running, first an image will open with a dialogue box. The patient has to concentrate on the centre fixation point and adjust his position of head so that the blind spot will not be visible to him anymore. After this click the OK button of the dialogue box to start the test.





 
GETTING THE RESULT:

All the minimum intensity values are stores in the array stimulus and their values are displayed in the Result Window as soon as they are found.
The result window is used as a debugging tool here and may produce disturbance during the test. This result window can be deactivated in the code making the particular line as a comment line.

//IJ.write(checkedPointCounter+"   "+i+"   "+j+"   "+stimulus[i][j].intensity);
